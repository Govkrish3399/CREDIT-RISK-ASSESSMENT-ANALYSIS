# CREDIT-RISK-ASSESSMENT-ANALYSIS

Introduction:

Banking and financial services intend to understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to consumers. In this project we try to understand the driving factors behind loan default. Bank and financial services can employ this wisdom for their risk assessment and portfolio.
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) helps to gain valuable insights using the existing data granted from client and loans in the past few years.

Problem Statements:

Identify the clients who have difficulty for paying their instalments, which may lead to taking the right actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending(to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

Find the feature of the requested loan that clients have/have not been able to reply it.

In this project, focus was on performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on a bank dataset, then identify driving factors that plays an important role in loan approval or credit decision. The business questions addressed where, 1) What are the top 3 correlated features with the credit decision or loan approval?. 2) How is education related with loan approval?. 3) How does contract type influence loan approval?. Utilized python to perform EDA on the bank dataset, discovering useful business insights, leading bank to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

The key learnings from this project:

Handling Missing values in the columns by incorporating functions like dropna() and isnull().sum().
Incorporated python outer join function to merge the datasets to discover business insights.
Addressed data imbalance.
Performed EDA on the merged dataset, unravelling business insights that could help the banking institution to make data informed decisions.
Observed differences in the default rates among contract types, this insights identified could help the lending institutions to tailor risk assessment and terms based on contract types.
Performed correlation analysis on the merged datasets, identified top 3 correlated factors relevant for loan approval or credit decision.
